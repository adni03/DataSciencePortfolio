# Hi there!

### My passion

I attribute my passion for computers and code to a couple of events in my life:
  * First was when I stumbled upon a YouTube tutorial on building web pages using HTML in the eighth grade. The fact that I could have a website of my own was exhilarating.
  * Next was when I learned to make the computer “think” and differentiate between images of cats and dogs.


### What I'm doing now

Programs that identify cats are inane yet showcase the breadth of applications machine learning has. In my opinion, Artificial Intelligence will become one of the cornerstones of technologies in the future. As a student specializing in Data Science at Carnegie Mellon University, I am excited to be a part of this new paradigm. Courses like Deep Learning, Data Science and Big Data, and Machine Learning will equip me with the tools required to be a successful data scientist.

### What keeps me going

Curiosity is what makes me tick. I can spend hours consuming content from all corners of the internet. This helps me develop a firm understanding of concepts after which, I look for ways to incorporate those ideas into my work. In the past, I realigned content on web pages in a more visually pleasing manner, rewrote code for efficiency, and fine-tuned documentation. I am always open to feedback and look to improve as I go along.

### What I do when I'm not working

During my downtime, you will find me discovering new music, playing pool, analyzing stocks, and cracking open a cold one with friends. Whenever possible, I watch Formula 1 races and episodes of The Office.
